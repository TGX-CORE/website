# Endpoint Methods

TGX-CORE Offers three methods while Telegram offers two.

- To set the enpoint method, set the option endpoint in [`ClientOptions#endpoint`](../../documentation/interfaces/ClientOptions#endpoint-endpoint)

## Long Polling
Long polling is the simplest way of having persistent connection with server, that doesnâ€™t use any specific protocol like WebSocket or Server Sent Events.

This is the default method set for TGX-CORE.

## Webhook
Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, Telegram will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL.

```js
new Client({

    endpoint: Endpoint.Webhook,

    webhook: {
        url: 'https://host-website.com', // https://host-website.com/webhook
        endpoint: '/webhook', // This is the default value.

        url: 'https://host-website.com/path', // https://host-website.com/path/endpoint
        endpoint: '/endpoint',

        port: 8080
    },

})
```

## Update Packet
If these methods are insufficient with your needs, you may implement your own method and then passing that update to the [`Client#poll#handle`](../../documentation/classes/PollManager#handle-update).

```js
new Cleint ({

    endpoint: Endpoint.UpdatePacket

})
```
```js
client.poll.handle(update)
```
