# Auxiliary Registries

With auxiliary registries, you can organize your data and code neatly. These are loaded when you initialize the client.

- Just create a folder named `auxiliaries` in your designated working directory.
- You may create or add folders and files.

To start using auxiliaries, visit the folder `Auxiliaries` [`Auxiliaries.Invoices`](../Auxiliaries/Invoices) and their corresponding children.
